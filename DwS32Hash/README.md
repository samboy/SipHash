This is a public domain implementation of a 32-bit variant of SipHash.
This implementation is designed to use the same data format as Deadwood's
strings.

Note that I came up with this variant on my own.  There is a more
official "Half Sip hash" 32-bit variant over at 
https://github.com/veorq/SipHash/blob/master/halfsiphash.c
